// Extra Notes:
- 'libcurl' library notes:
- Really easy to use, getting you connected to a server
- relatively quick
- When you initialize a library in C, you must use a pointer 
- variable because it allows us to have dynamic memory allocation
- Pointers make it easy when we are managing the libraries state
- The state refers to the way that the library is used and managed
- by the program at runtime
- What is the difference btw Dynamic and Static Libraries?
